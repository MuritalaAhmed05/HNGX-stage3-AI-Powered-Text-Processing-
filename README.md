## Core Features
### Text Processing
- **Language Detection:** Automatically detect the input text's language.
- **Summarization:** Summarize texts that are in English and exceed 150 characters.
- **Translation:** Convert text into English, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Turkish, and French.

### User Interface
- Chat-like interface for seamless interactions.
- Intuitive input and output display.
- Error handling for invalid or unsupported inputs.

### Accessibility
- Full support for screen readers.
- Keyboard-friendly navigation.
- Clear visual cues for focus and hover states.

### Responsive Design
- Optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Ensures readability and usability across all screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Input Handling
- Users should enter text in a designated input field.
- The system should detect the language before processing.
- Summarization should only work for English texts longer than 150 characters.
- Translation should only be available for supported languages.
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

### Output Generation
- Summarized text should be concise and meaningful.
- Detected language should be displayed clearly.
- Translated text should be accurate and formatted properly.

### Accessibility
- All UI components should be screen-reader-friendly.
- Users should be able to navigate using only the keyboard.

### Responsive Design
- The interface should adapt gracefully across various screen sizes.

### Code Quality
- Modular and well-structured code using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`).
- Maintainable and readable logic for text processing functions.
